# The guideme contract

Every guideme SDK is written from scratch in its own language. What they share is a contract,
and this repository is not where it is published. It lives in
[guideme-rust](https://github.com/pedro-pscunha/guideme-rust): the statement is
[`docs/contract.md`](https://github.com/pedro-pscunha/guideme-rust/blob/main/docs/contract.md)
and the machine-readable half is that repository's `spec/`. Read it there. Its three parts are
wire fidelity, policy conformance and interface shape, and this package satisfies all three.

`spec/` here is a copy of `spec/` there, and `spec/SOURCE` holds the guideme-rust commit it was
taken from. `spec/schema/*.json` are the shapes of `POST /v1/systemone`, which the wire models
validate against on the docs examples. `spec/vectors/policy.json` is the 42 golden vectors,
every one of which is a parametrised case of `tests/test_policy_vectors.py`: an entry with an
`outcome` must equal it by JSON equality, an entry with `error: "protocol"` must raise
`ProtocolError`. Nothing in `spec/` is edited here. A behaviour difference between this package
and another SDK is either a bug here or an ambiguity to resolve upstream; it is never fixed by
changing the copy.

The rendered rubric string is a contract item too. An option or a level written with
`option(…)`, `level(…)` or `fallback(…)` carries its examples beside its text, and the string
those compose into — clauses joined with a newline, items within one joined with `"; "`, the
text verbatim, and the text alone when there are no examples — is what goes on the wire. Every
guideme SDK composes the same string from the same parts, and `spec/vectors/rubric.json` is
where the renderers are held to each other. One asymmetry is deliberate: `choose_among` and
`score_levels` here take an `option(…)` or a `level(…)` value, while Rust's equivalents take a
string its derive macro has already composed, because that is where Rust's renderer lives.
Equivalent inputs put identical bytes on the wire.

Drift is caught rather than trusted. `mise run spec-check` clones guideme-rust, diffs its `spec/`
against this one and fails on any difference except `spec/SOURCE`, which is provenance and has
no counterpart upstream. It runs on every pull request as the `spec-drift` job of
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, which is a required check, and weekly from
`.github/workflows/spec-drift.yml`, so a contract change landing upstream turns this repository
red without anybody watching for it. `AGENTS.md` has the procedure for taking a new `spec/`.
